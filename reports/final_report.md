## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to develop a movie recommender system leveraging the MovieLens 100K dataset. The system is
designed to suggest movies to users based on their demographic information and their favorite movies. Our approach
involved experimenting with various machine learning models to find the most effective one for our needs.

## Data Analysis

The MovieLens 100K dataset consists of 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies. The data analysis phase involved
exploring these ratings along with demographic information (age, gender, occupation, zip code) of users. In this
section, we explored the distribution of user ratings, the age and gender demographics of users, the number of ratings
per user, and the popularity of different movie genres.

## Model Implementation

Three models were considered for this task: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), LightGBM Regressor (LGBMR), and
RandomForestRegressor. After experimentation and evaluation, RandomForestRegressor emerged as the most suitable model
for our system. The implementation involved preprocessing the data, splitting it into training and test sets, and
training the RandomForestRegressor model.

## Model Advantages and Disadvantages

- RandomForestRegressor (RMSE is 0.23392)

| Advantages                             | Disadvantages                                  |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Handles non-linear data effectively    | Computationally intensive                      |
| Robust to overfitting                  | Less interpretable compared to models like SVD |
| Good balance between bias and variance |                                                |

- Singular Value Decomposition (RMSE is 0.32343)

| Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Effective in capturing latent factors in data | Assumes linear relationships between variables |
| Scalable to large datasets                    | Sensitive to sparse and noisy data             |
| Good interpretability of results              | Requires careful handling of missing values    |

- LightGBM Regressor (RMSE is 0.68323)

| Advantages                                         | Disadvantages                                |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Fast training speed and efficiency                 | Can overfit on small datasets                |
| Handles large-sized data and supports GPU learning | Less interpretable compared to linear models |
| Good performance on unbalanced data                | Requires careful tuning of hyperparameters   |

## Training Process

The model's performance was evaluated by comparing the actual ratings with the predicted ratings.

This scatter plot with color coding illustrates the comparison between actual and predicted ratings, highlighting the
accuracy of the model.

## Evaluation

The model was evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. This metric was chosen as it effectively
captures the average error between the predicted and actual ratings, providing a clear measure of the model's accuracy.

## Results

The RandomForestRegressor model achieved an RMSE of 0.2339, indicating a high level of precision in predicting movie
ratings. This performance suggests that the model is well-suited for recommending movies to users based on their
preferences and demographic information.
